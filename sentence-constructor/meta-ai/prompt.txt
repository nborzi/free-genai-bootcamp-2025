    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Spanish | Type |
    |------|---------|------|
    | cat | gato | Noun (masculine) |
    | today | hoy | Adverb |
    | garden | jardín | Noun (masculine) |
    | to see | ver | Irregular Verb |
    | to find | encontrar | Regular -ar Verb |
    | worried | preocupado | Adjective |
    | because | porque | Conjunction |

    Sentence structure:
    [Verb-past] [Object] [Time]? [Subject] [Verb] [because] [Subject] [cannot] [Verb] [Object] [Location].

    Considerations:
    - First part is a question using past tense
    - Second part expresses a current state and reason
    - Personal 'a' is needed for animate objects
    - Possessive adjectives needed for 'our cats'

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask about question formation
    - ask about past tense conjugation
    - ask about negative forms
    - ask about possessive adjectives

Student Input: Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.

Following the good example format:

Cheatsheet:
| Word | Spanish | Type |
|------|---------|------|
| raven | cuervo | Noun (masculine) |
| morning | mañana | Noun (feminine) |
| garden | jardín | Noun (masculine) |
| to see | ver | Irregular Verb |
| to look at | mirar | Regular -ar Verb |
| this | este/esta | Demonstrative Adjective |

Sentence structure:
[Verb-past] [Article] [Object] [Demonstrative] [Time]? [Subject] [Verb-continuous] [Article] [Possessive] [Object].

Considerations:
- First part uses simple past tense
- Second part uses past continuous (imperfect)
- Demonstrative adjective agrees with feminine 'mañana'
- Time expression goes at end of question
- No personal 'a' needed for 'cuervo' as it's not a pet

Possible next steps:
- attempt an answer
- ask about past tense formation
- ask about continuous tense structure
- ask about demonstrative adjectives
- ask about time expressions
