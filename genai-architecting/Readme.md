# GenAI Local Implementation Architecture Guide
## Technical Reference Document

### 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the proposed architecture for implementing a local GenAI solution for an educational institution in Malaga, Spain, emphasising data privacy and long-term cost efficiency.

### 2. Business Context
- **Operation Scale**: 50 active students
- **Location**: Malaga (centralised location with consideration for Costa del Sol region coverage)
- **Infrastructure Budget**: 10-12K EUR
- **Key Priorities**:
  - Data privacy - Compliance with EU data protection regulations
  - Cost control - stay in budget
  - Latest and greatest multi-LLM, stay in line with edge tech 
  - The business will provide with structured metadata to access RAG

### 3. Proposed Architecture

#### 3.1 Technology Stack

**Model Layer:**
- Base Model: TBD 
- Framework: Hugging Face Transformers

**Application Layer:**
- Backend: Flask/Python
- Frontend: React
- Database: SQLite3 - Relational 
- Vector Store: ?
- Cache: Maybe Redis?
- Queue System: Maybe - not designed yet?

**Security Layer:**
- TBD - ideally Authentication: JWT, SSL/TLS
- Configured Firewall


### 4. Technical Considerations

#### 4.1 Resource Management
- Implementation of queue system for concurrent requests
- GPU and CPU usage monitoring
- Cache system for frequent responses
- Load balancing between CPU and GPU based on query type

#### 4.2 Data Strategy
- Local storage of licensed materials
- Educational content versioning system
- Document vector indexing
- Incremental backup system
- GDPR-compliant data handling procedures

#### 4.3 Optimisations
- Model fine-tuning for better performance
- Batch processing implementation
- Embedding cache
- Model compression
- Local CDN optimization for Malaga metropolitan area

### 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Server overload | Queue system and rate limits |
| Hardware failure | UPS and regular backups |
| Network latency | Local CDN and cache optimization |
| Data loss | RAID system and offsite backups |
| Temperature-related issues | Enhanced cooling system |


### 7. Implementation Recommendations
1. Start with pilot deployment
2. Implement monitoring from day 1 - Hypercare
3. Establish performance KPIs
4. Create regular maintenance plan
5. Document operational procedures


### 8. Next Steps
- Hardware specifications validation
- Load testing with appropriate model
- Initial POC development
- Security assessment
